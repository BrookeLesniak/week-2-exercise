1. What I built: I built a server that accepts a URL and checks if it returns a valid response through the use of a basic HTTP request.
2. How Claude Code helped: Claude code helped me through the use of this prompt that I gave it:
Create a simple MCP server for Claude Code.
The server should have one tool called "check-link" that:
- Accepts a URL, and checks if it returns a valid response
Please create:
1. package.json with the @modelcontextprotocol/sdk dependency
2. index.js with the complete server code
3. Clear comments explaining what each part does
Keep it simple - this is my first MCP server.
This single prompt was able to successfully give me a working MCP


3. What broke: The only error that I encountered through the entire process was when I was trying to initialize the project, for some reason my terminal wasn't able to recognize the command, but Claude was able to and everything went pretty smooth from there.
4. What I learned: I learned that MCP servers give your AI coding tools more features and can make complex tasks go a lot quicker. This allows the AI to work faster as you don't have to keep typing the same detailed prompt over and over again.
